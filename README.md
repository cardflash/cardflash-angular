**Blazingly fast create flashcards from PDFs**

This is the main repository for the [cardflash.net](https://cardflash.net) project.
It provides a user-friendly web app to create **flashcards** from PDF documents.
The created flashcards are linked back to the original source, so that the exact section in the PDF can be found again.
This enables users to browse the additional context without cluttering the card content.

The web app provides a clean study view where the created flashcards can be learned.
Additionally, cards can be synced to **Anki**.
A user-friendly card editor allows you to include rich content, like images, lists, and also **LaTeX** math formulas on your cards.

All data is per default, stored **securely only client-side** in your browser.
There is also an option to sync your cards with a free user account, but currently, those two storage types cannot be mixed.

For more information, visit our landing page at [cardflash.net](https://cardflash.net) or the main web-app [app.cardflash.net](https://app.cardflash.net).

Currently, the project is still in the early stages and under heavy development.
